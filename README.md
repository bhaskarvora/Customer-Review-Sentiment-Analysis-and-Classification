# Customer-Review-Sentiment-Analysis-and-Classification

## Comprehensive Data Preprocessing
Successfully cleaned and preprocessed a large dataset of customer reviews by handling missing values, correcting errors, and combining text fields for analysis.

## Advanced Feature Engineering
Implemented sophisticated feature engineering techniques, including sentiment analysis using NLTK and text preprocessing (tokenization, lemmatization, stopwords removal) to enhance model performance.

## Machine Learning Model Optimization
Evaluated and compared multiple machine learning models (e.g., Random Forest, LightGBM, Logistic Regression) using cross-validation and sampling techniques to handle class imbalance and optimize performance.

## Pipeline Integration and Evaluation
Built and tested end-to-end machine learning pipelines, integrating feature scaling, sampling, and classification, and evaluated model performance using weighted F1 scores.

## Data Visualization and Insights
Created informative visualizations to analyze and present data distributions and correlations, aiding in the understanding of the dataset and model performance.
